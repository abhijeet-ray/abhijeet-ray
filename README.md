# 👋 Hey, I’m Abhijeet Ray

**DevOps / Cloud / Infrastructure Engineer**  
**Vibe Coder** — I build systems, products, and experiments across domains.

I specialize in **turning ideas into working systems** — cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, AI-powered tools, and product-grade applications.  
If something needs to be built, automated, deployed, or scaled — I figure it out and ship it.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- ⚙️ Design and operate **cloud-native infrastructure**
- 🚀 Build **CI/CD pipelines** and deployment workflows
- 🤖 Create **AI & agent-based tools** with clear constraints and trade-offs
- 📦 Ship **indie products & hackathon projects**
- 🎮 Explore **game development** as a systems + architecture challenge
- 📚 Learn in public — but only things worth building

I don’t just write code — I **design execution paths**.

## 📌 Featured Work (Pinned Repositories)

🔹 **DevOps / Cloud Projects**  
Infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies, and monitoring setups.

🔹 **AI & Agent Experiments**  
Tools that explain *trade-offs* instead of giving single answers.  
Focused on steering LLM behavior using constraints and context.

🔹 **MLOps / AI Infra**  
Experiments around deploying, evaluating, and operationalizing models.

🔹 **Indie & Hackathon Builds**  
Fast execution, clean READMEs, real outcomes.

🔹 **Game Dev Systems**  
Exploring game development as a serious engineering discipline.

## 🏆 Hackathons & Experiments

I actively participate in hackathons and rapid-build challenges where:
- Speed matters
- Documentation matters
- Clear thinking beats flashy demos

Most projects here are **built to prove execution**, not just ideas.

---

## 🚧 Current Focus

- Advanced DevOps & Cloud Architecture  
- AI agents & decision systems  
- MLOps pipelines  
- Building products that actually ship

---

## 🤝 Open To

- DevOps / Cloud / Infra roles  
- AI & MLOps engineering roles  
- Early-stage startup work  
- Serious hackathons & collaborations

📫 **Let’s build something real.**
